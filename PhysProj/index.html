                    <p>Coulomb's law, or Coulomb's inverse-square law, is an experimental law of physics that quantifies the amount of force between two stationary, electrically charged particles. The electric force between charged bodies at rest is conventionally called electrostatic force or Coulomb force. The law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: </p>

                    <p>Here, k<sub>e</sub> is Coulomb's constant (k<sub>e</sub> ≈ 8.988×109 N⋅m<sup>2</sup>⋅C<sup>-2</sup>), q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> are the signed magnitudes of the charges, and the scalar r is the distance between the charges. The force is along the straight line joining the two charges. If the charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Faraday's Law</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="column right">
                    <p>Faraday's law of induction (briefly, Faraday's law) is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (EMF)—a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The most widespread version of Faraday's law states: <br><i><b><center>The electromotive force around a closed path is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the path.</center></b></i>The closed path here is, in fact, conductive.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For a loop of wire in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux ΦB is defined for any surface Σ whose boundary is the given loop. Since the wire loop may be moving, we write Σ(t) for the surface. The magnetic flux is the surface integral:</p>
                    <br><center><div class="image"><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84c87bac645d3c5dc9aae544b4e3cab7e55e1800"></div></center><br>
                    <p>where dA is an element of surface area of the moving surface Σ(t), B is the magnetic field, and B·dA is a vector dot product representing the element of flux through dA. In more visual terms, the magnetic flux through the wire loop is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the loop.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When the flux changes—because B changes, or because the wire loop is moved or deformed, or both—Faraday's law of induction says that the wire loop acquires an EMF, defined as the energy available from a unit charge that has traveled once around the wire loop. (Some sources state the definition differently. This expression was chosen for compatibility with the equations of Special Relativity) Equivalently, it is the voltage that would be measured by cutting the wire to create an open circuit, and attaching a voltmeter to the leads.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Faraday's law states that the EMF is also given by the rate of change of the magnetic flux:</p>
                    <br><center><div class="image"><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58f8234e421fb6136204fc4785c6a8ffc74d8834"></div></center><br>
                    <p>where ε is the electromotive force (EMF) and ΦB is the magnetic flux.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The direction of the electromotive force is given by Lenz's law.</p>
